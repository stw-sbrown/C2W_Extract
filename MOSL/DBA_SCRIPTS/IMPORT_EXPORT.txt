# Steps needed to save the key gen table and restore it to another schema

1,save of the table, make sure your Oracle environment is set for the schema you are exporting from, the following
command exports the table from  DOWD (RECEPTION) 
exp userid=RECEPTION/DOWD file=TVMNHHDTL.dmp tables=TVMNHHDTL

2, Change ORACLE_SID to the environment you are restoring to, for example, DOWP
3, Log on to the RECEPTION area in DOWP and drop the table TVMNHHDTL using SQLPlus, then exit from SQLPlus
4, Import the data into the schema using the following command.
imp RECEPTION/DOWD file=TVMNHHDTL.dmp tables=TVMNHHDTL

Note
When specifying the file name it the export/import routine check the folder you are in.  so, if you are in 
/recload/DOWD/MOSL and you run the export, then change to /recload/DOWP/MOSL and run the import 
as detailed above it will NOT find the backup file.  

Make sure you run the export/import from the same directory, or, alter the "file" parameter to point directly to 
where the export file is located
