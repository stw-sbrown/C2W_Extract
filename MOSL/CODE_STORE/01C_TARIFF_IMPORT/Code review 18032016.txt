Sree,

I’ve been through the updates you’ve made to the Tariff procedures following the review.

Please ensure that you apply the following CHANGES as stated below:

1.	The new procedure you created ‘P_TARIFF_RUN’ MUST BE DELETED. The code review comment ask you to automate the batch status call not create a new procedure.
2.	INSERT  a call to the common function   P_STARTBATCH at the beginning on the P_MIG_TARIFF package (keeping all procedures within the PACKAGE, see P_MIG_BATCH for an example!).
3.	Pass the BATCH number and job to each of the procedures you subsequently call for the tariffs.
4.	When you have loaded the tariffs then call the common function FN_UPDATEBATCH to close the Batch run from within the P_MIG_TARIFF.
5.	Provide Nigel with a .sql file to populate the MIG_JOBREF table with the Job details for each procedure you call. This file needs to be included in the build scripts so that the table is always prepopulated.

Please re-test and update the unit test plan to show you have tested the changes above.

Note: you cannot create a procedure/package THAT IS NOT LISTED in the Control Document.
